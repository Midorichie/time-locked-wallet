# Time-Locked Wallet System - Stacks Blockchain

## Overview
This enhanced Clarity smart contract system provides secure time-locked storage for STX tokens. The system includes two main contracts: a single enhanced vault and a multi-vault manager for advanced users.

## üöÄ Features

### Enhanced Vault Contract (`vault.clar`)
- **Secure Time Locking**: Lock STX until a specified block height
- **Owner Management**: Transfer ownership with two-step verification
- **Emergency Controls**: Emergency unlock capability for critical situations
- **Deposit Tracking**: Complete history of all deposits and withdrawals
- **Balance Management**: Real-time balance checking and validation
- **Enhanced Security**: Multiple error codes and validation checks

### Multi-Vault Manager (`multi-vault.clar`)
- **Multiple Vaults**: Create up to 50 individual time-locked vaults per user
- **Individual Management**: Each vault has its own unlock time and balance
- **Vault Lifecycle**: Create, fund, withdraw, and close vaults independently
- **User Dashboard**: Track all vaults owned by a user
- **Emergency Features**: Emergency withdrawal capabilities

## üîß Bug Fixes from Phase 1
1. **Fixed Deposit Function**: Now actually transfers STX to the contract
2. **Enhanced Withdraw Logic**: Proper balance checking and validation
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error codes and assertions
4. **Security Improvements**: Multiple layers of validation

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Enhancements
- **Two-step ownership transfer**: Prevents accidental ownership loss
- **Emergency unlock system**: Owner can unlock in critical situations
- **Balance validation**: Prevents over-withdrawal attempts
- **Input validation**: All functions validate inputs thoroughly
- **Event tracking**: Complete audit trail of all operations

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) installed
- Stacks CLI tools

### Installation
```bash

### Basic Usage

#### Single Vault
```clarity
;; Deploy and deposit 1000 STX
(contract-call? .vault deposit u1000)

(contract-call? .vault set-unlock-block (+ block-height u1000))

;; Check if unlocked
(contract-call? .vault is-unlocked)

;; Withdraw after unlock (owner only)
(contract-call? .vault withdraw u500 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM)
```

#### Multi-Vault
```clarity
;; Create a new vault
(contract-call? .multi-vault create-vault (+ block-height u500))

;; Deposit to vault ID 1
(contract-call? .multi-vault deposit-to-vault u1 u1000)

;; Check vault status
(contract-call? .multi-vault get-vault u1)

;; Withdraw after unlock
(contract-call? .multi-vault withdraw-from-vault u1 u500 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM)
```
